# Email Template Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to create an engaging and effective email template for the "One-Click Instant Feedback Collection" Zapier automation (Zap).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A Zapier account.
- An email account that can be used to send feedback forms.
- A feedback form hosted on a platform like Google Forms, Typeform, or SurveyMonkey.

## Step 1: Define Your Email Structure

Your email should have a clear and concise structure. Here's a suggested structure:

1. Greeting: Personalize this section to make the recipient feel valued.
2. Introduction: Briefly explain the purpose of the email.
3. Feedback Request: Include the link to the feedback form and encourage the recipient to fill it out.
4. Closing: Thank the recipient for their time and sign off.

## Step 2: Write Your Email Content

Here's an example of how you might write the email content:

```
Subject: Your Feedback is Valued!

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. We recently had a meeting/event and we would love to hear your thoughts about it.

Please take a few minutes to fill out this feedback form: [Feedback Form Link]. Your feedback is crucial for us to improve our services and provide a better experience in the future.

Thank you for your time and valuable input.

Best Regards,
[Your Name]
```

## Step 3: Configure Your Email Template in Zapier

1. Log in to your Zapier account and go to your "One-Click Instant Feedback Collection" Zap.
2. In the action step where you've chosen your email platform, locate the "Body" field.
3. Paste your email content into the "Body" field. Make sure to replace `[Recipient's Name]`, `[Feedback Form Link]`, and `[Your Name]` with the appropriate dynamic fields or static text.
4. Save your changes.

## Conclusion

Your email template is now ready to be used in your Zap. Whenever the button is pressed, it will trigger the Zap and send your customized email with the feedback form to the designated recipient(s). If you encounter any issues, refer to `Troubleshooting_Guide.md`.
