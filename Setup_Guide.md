# Setup Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up the "One-Click Instant Feedback Collection" Zapier automation (Zap). 

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A Zapier account.
- An IoT button like Flic or a virtual button in a mobile app that integrates with Zapier.
- An email account that can be used to send feedback forms.
- A platform to host your feedback form, such as Google Forms, Typeform, or SurveyMonkey.

## Step 1: Button Configuration

The first step is to configure your IoT or virtual button. This will be used to trigger the Zap. For detailed instructions, refer to `Button_Configuration.md`.

## Step 2: Create the Feedback Form

Next, you need to create a feedback form that will be sent to the recipients. This form can be hosted on platforms like Google Forms, Typeform, or SurveyMonkey. For detailed instructions on how to create and link the feedback form, refer to `Feedback_Form_Guide.md`.

## Step 3: Zap Configuration

Once the button and feedback form are ready, you can create the Zap in Zapier. This involves setting up the button press as the trigger and configuring the action to send an email or message with the feedback form link. For detailed instructions, refer to `Zap_Configuration.md`.

## Step 4: Email/Message Customization

The next step is to customize the content of the email or message that will be sent to the recipients. This includes a personalized greeting and a brief explanation encouraging the recipient to provide their feedback. For detailed instructions on how to customize the email or message content, refer to `Email_Template.md`.

## Step 5: Test the Zap

Finally, you should thoroughly test the Zap to ensure it works correctly. This includes checking that the button press correctly triggers the Zap and that the email or message is sent to the correct recipients with the correct content.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup or use of the automation, refer to `Troubleshooting_Guide.md`.

## Conclusion

Once you have completed these steps, you should have a fully functioning "One-Click Instant Feedback Collection" Zap. This will allow you to quickly and easily gather feedback from clients or team members immediately after a meeting or event.
