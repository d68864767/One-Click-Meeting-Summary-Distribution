# Feedback Form Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create and link a feedback form for the "One-Click Instant Feedback Collection" Zapier automation (Zap).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A platform to host your feedback form, such as Google Forms, Typeform, or SurveyMonkey.

## Step 1: Choose a Platform

Choose a platform to host your feedback form. This could be Google Forms, Typeform, or SurveyMonkey. The platform you choose should allow you to create a form and share a link to it.

## Step 2: Create the Feedback Form

1. Log in to your chosen platform.
2. Create a new form. The form should include questions that will help you gather the feedback you need. This could include rating scales, multiple choice questions, or open-ended questions.
3. Customize the form to match your branding, if desired.

## Step 3: Get the Form Link

Once you have created the form, you need to get the link to it. This is usually done by clicking on a "Share" or "Send" button and copying the link provided. Make sure the link allows anyone with the link to fill out the form.

## Step 4: Use the Form Link in Your Zap

The final step is to use the form link in your Zap. This will be done in the action step of your Zap, where you configure the email or message that will be sent to the recipients. The link to the feedback form should be included in the body of the email or message. For detailed instructions on how to configure the Zap, refer to `Zap_Configuration.md`.

## Conclusion

Once you have completed these steps, you should have a feedback form that can be easily sent to clients or team members immediately after a meeting or event. This will allow you to quickly and easily gather feedback, helping you to continually improve your services.
