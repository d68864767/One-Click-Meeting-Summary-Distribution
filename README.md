# One-Click Instant Feedback Collection

This project is a Zapier automation (Zap) that allows you to instantly send a feedback form to a client or team member immediately after a meeting or event at the press of a button. This streamlines the process of gathering immediate and relevant feedback.

## How It Works

1. **Button Press as Trigger**: An IoT button like Flic or a virtual button in a mobile app that integrates with Zapier is used. Pressing this button initiates the automation.

2. **Send Feedback Form**: Upon pressing the button, the Zap triggers an email or a message with a link to a feedback form. This form can be hosted on platforms like Google Forms, Typeform, or SurveyMonkey.

3. **Email/Message Customization**: The message or email can be pre-configured with a personalized greeting and a brief explanation, encouraging the recipient to provide their feedback.

4. **Recipient Identification**: The recipient(s) of the feedback request can be predetermined (like the last client from your calendar appointment) or manually entered.
