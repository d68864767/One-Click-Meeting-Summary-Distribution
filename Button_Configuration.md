# Button Configuration Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to configure your IoT or virtual button to trigger the "One-Click Instant Feedback Collection" Zapier automation (Zap).

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- An IoT button like Flic or a virtual button in a mobile app that integrates with Zapier.
- A device to connect your IoT button to, such as a smartphone or tablet.

## Step 1: Choose Your Button

First, you need to decide whether you want to use a physical IoT button or a virtual button in a mobile app. Both options have their pros and cons, so choose the one that best suits your needs.

## Step 2: Set Up Your Button

### If you're using an IoT button:

1. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to connect your button to your device. This usually involves downloading a companion app and pairing the button with your device via Bluetooth.
2. In the companion app, you should be able to configure what happens when the button is pressed. Choose an action that can be recognized by Zapier, such as sending an HTTP request or triggering a webhook.

### If you're using a virtual button:

1. Download a mobile app that allows you to create virtual buttons and integrates with Zapier. Examples include IFTTT, Button Widget, or Tasker.
2. In the app, create a new button and configure it to trigger an action that can be recognized by Zapier, such as sending an HTTP request or triggering a webhook.

## Step 3: Connect Your Button to Zapier

1. Log in to your Zapier account and create a new Zap.
2. For the trigger, choose the action that you configured your button to perform (e.g., HTTP request, webhook).
3. Follow the instructions to connect your button to Zapier. This usually involves entering the URL or key provided by Zapier into your button's settings.

## Step 4: Test Your Button

Finally, press your button to test if it correctly triggers the Zap in Zapier. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the Zap run in your Zapier dashboard.

## Conclusion

Once you have completed these steps, your button should be ready to use with the "One-Click Instant Feedback Collection" Zap. Whenever you press the button, it will trigger the Zap and send a feedback form to the designated recipient(s).
